<h1>Machine Learning & Deep Learning </h1>
<br>
<p> The models found in this repository were based on the data cleaned in the branch: <b>cleaning</b></p>
<br>
<p>Both Machine and Deep learning used data from 2018 to <b>TRAIN</b> whilst data from 2019 was used to <b>TEST</b> the models</p>
<br>
<p>The goal was to predict which workers that were active during 2018 would quit during 2019 by using Supervised Classification</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Machine Learning:</b> was based on Logistic Regression.

        <li>Testing Data Score: 0.7332278095701936</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Deep Learning:</b> used a Sequential model with ReLU as the activation function and Categorical Crossentropy as the loss function
